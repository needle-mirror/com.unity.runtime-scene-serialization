### About Unity Runtime Scene Serialization
Use Runtime Scene Serialization to save and load scenes in Unity Player builds.

To test this functionality in the Editor, try opening a scene and going to *File > Save JSON Scene...*. Make a new scene, then *Choose File > Open JSON Scene...* choose the scene you just saved, and you should see the same objects as if you had opened the Unity scene.

To use this in your project, simply call `SerializationUtils.SerializeScene` on the curently loaded scene you would like to serialize, and call `SerializationUtils.DeserializeScene` to parse a JSON scene and create the objects within.
